Copies your Token into the clipboard.<br>
**:warning: DO NOT GIVE THIS TO ANYONE. It grants full access to your account.**

Paste this into the console (while being logged in):

```js
window.webpackChunkdiscord_app.push([[Math.random()], {}, (req) => {for (const m of Object.keys(req.c).map((x) => req.c[x].exports).filter((x) => x)) {if (m.default && m.default.getToken !== undefined) {return copy(m.default.getToken())}if (m.getToken !== undefined) {return copy(m.getToken())}}}]); console.log("%cDone!", "font-size: 50px"); console.log(`%cYou now have your token in the clipboard!`, "font-size: 16px")
```

The token should be in your clipboard now.<br>
Please be careful when pasting the token, sending it to someone is like giving away your address, keys and passport/ID.<br>
Someone who knows your token can impersonate you, mess with your friends and servers, spend your money (if you added a payment method for nitro), and even figure out your IP-Adress (aka. probably your real-life home adress) using the new devices feature.
